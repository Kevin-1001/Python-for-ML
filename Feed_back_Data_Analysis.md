# Analysis of Participant Feedback on Training Sessions

## 1. Introduction:

This report delves into the analysis of participant feedback obtained from training sessions conducted by the organization. The data encompasses responses from participants regarding various aspects of the training sessions, including the quality of content, effectiveness of delivery, expertise of resource persons, relevance to real-world scenarios, and overall organization of the sessions.

## 2. Importing Libraries:

We begin by importing the necessary Python libraries for data analysis and visualization, including NumPy, pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
```

## 3. Loading Data:

The dataset containing participant feedback is retrieved from the organization's GitHub repository and loaded into a pandas DataFrame for further analysis.

```python
df_class=pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sijuswamy/Intel-Unnati-sessions/main/Feed_back_data.csv")
```

## 4. Data Wrangling:

### Dropping Unnecessary Columns:

Columns such as Timestamp, Email ID, and Additional Comments are removed from the dataset to simplify the analysis and focus on relevant information.

```python
df_class = df_class.drop(['Timestamp','Email ID','Please provide any additional comments, suggestions, or feedback you have regarding the session. Your insights are valuable and will help us enhance the overall learning experience.'],axis=1)
```

### Renaming Columns:

Columns are renamed to improve clarity and consistency throughout the analysis, ensuring a better understanding of the data.

```python
df_class.columns = ["Name","Branch","Semester","Resourse Person","Content Quality","Effeciveness","Expertise","Relevance","Overall Organization"]
```

## 5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

### Resource Persons Distribution:

We examine the distribution of feedback across different resource persons who conducted the training sessions. Visualizations such as count plots and pie charts are utilized to illustrate this distribution effectively.

### Ratings Across Different Aspects:

Box plots are employed to visualize the distribution of ratings provided by participants across various aspects, including content quality, effectiveness, expertise, and relevance.

## 6. Summary of Responses:

A summary of responses is provided, incorporating statistical measures and visualizations to synthesize the feedback received from participants, enabling a comprehensive understanding of their perspectives.

## 7. Using K-means Clustering:

### Finding the Best Value of k Using Elbow Method:

The Elbow Method is employed to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for K-means clustering, facilitating the segmentation of participants based on satisfaction levels.

### Using Gridsearch Method:

Gridsearch is utilized to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the K-means clustering algorithm, ensuring optimal performance in segmenting the participants.

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
param_grid = {'n_clusters': [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]}
kmeans = KMeans(n_init='auto',random_state=42)
grid_search = GridSearchCV(kmeans, param_grid, cv=5)
grid_search.fit(X)
best_params = grid_search.best_params_
best_score = grid_search.best_score_
```

### Implementing K-means Clustering:

K-means clustering is implemented with the determined optimal number of clusters, enabling the identification of distinct segments among participants based on their feedback.

```python
k = 3 
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=k,n_init='auto', random_state=42)
kmeans.fit(X)
```

## 8. Extracting Labels and Cluster Centers:

Cluster labels and centroids are extracted post-clustering, providing insights into the characteristics of each cluster and facilitating further analysis.

## 9. Visualizing the Clustering:

The clustering results are visualized using the first two features to gain insights into participant segmentation based on satisfaction levels, aiding in the interpretation of the clustering outcome.

## 10. Conclusion

After conducting a thorough analysis of the participant feedback data from the training sessions, several key insights have emerged:

i. Resource Person Distribution: The distribution of feedback across different resource persons indicates that Mrs. Akshara Sasidharan and Mrs. Veena A Kumar conducted a significant proportion of the training sessions, each accounting for approximately 34.48% and 31.03% of the sessions, respectively. Dr. Anju Pratap and Mrs. Gayathri J L conducted a relatively smaller proportion of sessions, each at 17.24%.

ii. Ratings Across Different Aspects: The analysis of ratings provided by participants across various aspects reveals that the majority of participants rated the training sessions positively. Specifically, the ratings for content quality, effectiveness of delivery, expertise of resource persons, relevance to real-world scenarios, and overall organization of the sessions were predominantly high, indicating a favorable perception among participants.

iii. Clustering Analysis: Utilizing K-means clustering, participants were segmented into distinct clusters based on their satisfaction levels. The optimal number of clusters was determined to be three using the Elbow Method and Gridsearch technique. Further examination of the clustering results revealed distinct segments among participants, providing valuable insights into their varying levels of satisfaction and preferences.

iv. Segment Interpretation: The clustering analysis facilitated the interpretation of participant segments based on their feedback. These segments may represent different levels of engagement, satisfaction, or areas of improvement within the training sessions. Understanding these segments can inform targeted strategies for enhancing future training sessions and improving overall participant experience.

Overall, the analysis of participant feedback has provided valuable insights into the effectiveness of the training sessions and highlighted areas for potential improvement. By leveraging these insights, the organization can refine its training methodologies, tailor content delivery to better meet participant needs, and ultimately enhance the overall learning experience for participants.
